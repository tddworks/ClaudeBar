/// This is the whole decision layer of the feature and it is deliberately pure:
/// no clock of its own, no network, no settings lookups. What to show, in what
/// order, in what words, and in what color is decided here so it can be tested
/// as plain state assertions.
///
/// The rules:
/// 1. The worst quota leads. Readings sort by status severity, then by how
///    little is left, so the number that needs attention is the headline and
///    the tile takes its color and progress bar from it.
/// 2. The tile carries up to six windows as a metrics row, because six is the
///    gateway's ceiling and more than six is unreadable on a Lock Screen.
/// 3. Labels drop the provider name when every reading comes from the same
///    provider, so a single provider tile reads "5h  7d" rather than
///    "Claude 5h  Claude 7d".
/// 4. Percentages are remaining, not used. Every ClaudeBar surface reads that
///    way, and a full bar meaning a full quota is the only intuitive mapping
///    for a gauge.
